Sharkfest was amazing! It was 3-day's of pre-conference training and 2-days of conference presentations.

I had an absolute blast. 

TL;DR: If you support a network in any capacity, operations/security/performance, you need to attend at least one Sharkfest and all offered trainings.

Diving into packets isn't for everyone. It takes a certain kind of person and the right personality to find all this facinating ...I think I'm the right kind of person.

Every part of the conference was virtual this year. All the trainings and presentations were through Zoom and general chatting, messaging and anouncements were through Discord. I think the Sharkfest staff did an excellent job hosting the conference virtually. I believe everything went off without a hitch. Transitions were pretty smooth and the whole conference had a nive flow to it. 

I have never been to an in-person Sharkfest (this year would've been my first), so I don't have anything to compare this to but I felt like I got my money's worth. I will definitely be attending next year whether virtual or in-person. I feel there's still alot more to learn.

## Monday & Tuesday
#### Troubleshooting with Wireshark - Core Skills with Chris Greer
I absolutely can't say enough great things about Chris Greer. If you have an opportunity to take a training from Chris, DO IT! I gaurantee you will learn something if not many things.

Through 2-days, Chris walks us all through the Wireshark interface, while introducing networking layers and working through PCAP's. This was a mix of slide material, live demonstration and a go at your own pace labs. Chris, in my opinion, is well known for his TCP classes and this training was definitely inclusive of that. He teaches you all about the protocol and how to setup Wireshark profiles to more efficiently analyze your data.

I learned a ton and more than that I learned about what I don't know and what I took for granted. This has put my packet analysis journey in high gear. the next time I take one of Chris' classes, I'll be ready for the hard questions.

I walked away from the training with a good understanding of TCP options, Selective-Acknowledgements, TCP Retransmissions and some neat efficiencies in operating Wireshark with custom profiles.

Chris Greer is every where, if you're interested in learning more just search for: `Chris Greer TCP` or `Chris Greer Wireshark` you'll find him.

That was an amazing way to start the week.

## Wednesay
#### SSL/TLS Troubleshooting with Wireshark with Sake Blok
I signed up for this training becasue of all the TLS I see on a regular basis. I wanted to dive in and try to understand it on a much deeper level.

Sake calls himself a "Relational therapist for computer systems" which is quite funny and has kind of a double meaning given what he does for a living; packet analysis.

I've seen Sake's previous Sharkfest talks on YouTube and even did a webinar with him and the Cloudshark team a couple years ago. I thought I knew what to expect. I didn't. Alot of this was way over my head. Despite my trouble understanding all the facets of TLS and PKI I was able to follow along and actually learned a number of this. I'll be straight with everyone, you should definitely have a pretty solid base understanding of PKI before attempting this class, I did not. I have a ver remedial understanding of PKI. This was my fault **not** Sake's.

When you're looking at all this network traffic under the microscope of Wireshark and examing PKI and TLS I can't help but wonder with surprise that it all works.

Sake did a great job of starting from the begining of SSL and walking all the way through TLS 1.3 including eSNI. I think this was an important path to show the evolution of where TLS came from and how we got to where we are and why.

While I still need to go back and study it a bit more before it all sinks in at least I got alot of great exposure to all the terms in SSL and TLS. This is the first step to the bigger understanding. Terms like: 
- OCSP and OCSP stapling
- Cetificate Revocation List (and what information is in them and what they look like)
- Certificate Types: Domain Validation, Extended Validation & Organization Validation (the difference between the types)
- Common Names
- Subject Alternative Names: 'DNS Names' and why they exist

If you can't already define the purpose of the above items then perhaps you need to take a class too :)
