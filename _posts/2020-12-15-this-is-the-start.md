  up and fills you drive and desire. This is the start of that.

Starting something new is exciting!!! In the recent weeks Jordan Martin and I started the Network Collective live stream. We are streaming network discussions, talking with special guests, doing trivia, having fun with current events and more. This has been a really exciting new venture that combines alot of the things I wanted to do, in a way that the community can participate live.

> This ain't your daddy's zoom call.

We've been stremaing on YouTube, Twitch and Twitter, Wednesday evenings from 8pm to ~10pm (EST) and all *you* have to do is show up in the chat and say "Hi!". :wave:

#### Why is this exciting? 
We've put together a great framework that allows us real time live interaction with the audience. No longer is hearing Network Collective like UDP (1-way converstation), now it's more like TCP (a 3-way handshake with bi-directional payloads). 

Have you ever listened and thought you wish you could just chime in and drop your 2-cents. Now you can! Use these links and Subscribe/Follow join us on Wednesday nights and tell us what you're up to:
- YouTube  <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i>: [https://www.youtube.com/networkcollective](https://www.youtube.com/networkcollective)
- Twitch.tv  <i class="fab fa-twitch"></i>: [https://www.twitch.tv/networkcollective](https://www.twitch.tv/networkcollective)

In just 4 stremaing weeks we've given away prizes including: t-shirts, coffee mugs, Network Collective swag bags.

Starting in 2021 we are introducing a few new segments that we'll add to the stream and might be upping our game for give aways. You won't want to miss it, I'm very excited for this.

> Let us be your late night cut-over networking entertainment.

It's no secret that while people continue to work from home, how they consume media is changing. Also changing is, how they interact with those in their online and personal communities. That's exactly why this was so necessary. Also, by giving ourselves a canvas enables us to share and introduce things that couldn't be done in an audio only podcast broadening the topics we can talk about and demonstrate.

I hope you all will join us for the fun. [Send me a message](https://www.twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=showipintbri) and let me know you've subscribed.
