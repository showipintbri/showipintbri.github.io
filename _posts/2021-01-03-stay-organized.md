Every goal should be achievable if supported by the right system. You need to have a value adding supporting system in place that allows you to track your progress, hit your milestones and each day bring your goal closer into focus.

> Focus on systems, not on goals.

There are lots of tools available out there (as I have found) specifically designed to tracking tasks and settings goals. Find the right one for you and go for it!

## My Goals
On Dec. 31, 2020 I set some lofty goals for 2021:
  - [ ] I want to grow the [NetworkCollective podcast](https://networkcollective.com/).
  - [ ] I want to continue to develop and grow the [NetworkCollective Live Stream](https://www.youtube.com/networkcollective)
  - [ ] I want to speak at 2 conferences.
  - [ ] I want [DevNet Assoc.](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/devnet-associate)
  - [ ] I want [GIAC: NFA](https://www.giac.org/certification/network-forensic-analyst-gnfa)
  - [ ] I want [GIAC: CIA](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-intrusion-analyst-gcia)
  - [ ] I want to move my email off of Gmail.
  - [ ] I want to read a few books (fiction/non-fiction/study/certification/tech)

By Jan 2nd 2021, I started on my DevNet Assoc. journey and found myself realizing this is a **real** certification and not something I can just commit the bare minimum hoping to get lucky. I realized I need to make a plan, a **real** plan. A plan with milestones and timekeeping, tracking resources and more. Since completing my CCIE almost a year ago I haven't needed to build a plan like this and admittedly I was out of practice on *how to learn*.

On Twitter, I asked this simple question: 
<p align=center>
<a href="https://twitter.com/showipintbri/status/1345789441907052550"><img src="/assets/images/posts/2021-01-03-stay-organized/tweet-21-01-03.jpg"></a>
</p>

The responses were so numerous I wanted to aggregate them here. I'm also scoring them, in brackets, based on the number of responses I got about them.

As I work through and test some of these tools while studying for my certifications, I'll write some reviews here or you can always be sure I'll be sharing any-and-all tips via Tiwtter.

## Next Steps
[Nick Russo](https://twitter.com/nickrusso42518) has put together a [study plan for Devasc](http://njrusmc.net/jobaid/devasc_studyplan.xlsx) that has helped many prepare for the exam. I will be primarily using this along with the [DevNet training/certification bundle](https://developer.cisco.com/classof2020/bundle/) I purchased. I would like to complete this journey by the cut-off for DevNet class of 2020 but it's not mandatory, I just prefer hard deadlines to drive schedules.
